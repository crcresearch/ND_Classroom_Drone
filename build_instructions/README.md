==
## Required tools
* Access to a 3D printer capable of printing PLA or ABS
* 2mm hex wrench
* 1.5mm Hex Wrench
* Nut driver or wrench
* Wire Cutters
* Wire Strippers
* Solder Iron

## Notes on assembly
* Note1: We do not advise the use of locktight on any screws if this is your first time assembling the drone as mistakes can be made requiring disassmbly later in the build stage but do recommend its use once you are familiar with the process.

* Note2: With practice it should be possible to complete the assembly of this drone once all parts have been gathered and printed within one (1) day, however, this excludes flight testing and it is likely to take longer the first time for a new user
