Configuring Raspberry Pi
==

Ubuntu Image
--

- Download [Ubuntu 18.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/18.04/release/ubuntu-18.04.2-preinstalled-server-armhf+raspi2.img.xz)
- Burn image onto SD Card. [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) works well and is easy to use.
- Insert SD Card into Raspberry Pi, connect keyboard, mouse and monitor and then power.
